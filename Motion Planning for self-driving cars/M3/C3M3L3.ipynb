    "# Ray tracing\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ray tracing is a computer graphics technique used to simulate realistic lightning and shadows in digital images by tracing the path of light rays as they interact with objects in a scene. By calculating how light travels, reflects, refracts and is absorved, ray tracing can produce highly realistic visuals that closely mimic real-world lighting effects. \n",

    "- Uses very cheap fixed point operations for fast calculation\n",
    "- Perform update on each beam from the LIDAR rather then each cell on the grid\n",

    "- Much cheaper per operation"
