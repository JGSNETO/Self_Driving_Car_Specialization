    "\n",
    "- Feature extractors are the most computationally expensive component of the 2D object detector\n",
    "- The output of feature extractors usually has much lower width and height than those of the input image, but much greater depth\n",
    "- Very active area of research, with new extractors proposed on regular basis\n",
    "- Most common extractor are: VGG, ResNet and inception\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- 2D object detectors can be performed using convolutional neural networks\n",
    "- Usually, anchor boxes are used as priors for the neural network to shift around to achieve object classification and localization"
