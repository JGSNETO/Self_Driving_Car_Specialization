    "# Road Network Graph in Self-Driving Cars\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Road Network Graph** is a graph-based representation of the road network that helps self-driving cars understand, navigate, and plan routes efficiently. This graph consists of **nodes** (points like intersections or waypoints) and **edges** (connections between nodes, representing road segments). Here’s how it works and why it’s vital for self-driving technology:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Components of a Road Network Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Nodes**  \n",
    "   - Represent key points within the road network, such as intersections, entry/exit points, and lane merge points.\n",
    "   - Each node includes attributes like GPS coordinates, altitude, and any traffic control details (e.g., stop signs or traffic lights).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Edges**  \n",
    "   - Edges connect nodes, representing paths or road segments.\n",
    "   - Each edge includes attributes such as road type (e.g., highway, residential), speed limits, lane count, and additional details as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Lane-Level Graphing**  \n",
    "   - Advanced road network graphs incorporate lane-specific edges and nodes, breaking down road segments into individual lanes.\n",
    "   - This detailed information supports lane-level routing and precise navigation.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Regulatory and Traffic Flow Information**  \n",
    "   - Traffic rules, including directionality (one-way, two-way), turning restrictions, speed limits, and priority information, are embedded within the graph.\n",
    "   - These attributes allow the vehicle to follow local road rules and maintain safe interactions in traffic.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Topology and Connectivity**  \n",
    "   - The graph provides a topological view of the road network, showing how roads, intersections, and lanes are interconnected.\n",
    "   - Connectivity data is essential for route planning, as it enables the vehicle to understand legal paths and avoid restricted areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Importance of Road Network Graphs for Self-Driving Cars\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Path Planning**  \n",
    "  The graph structure enables autonomous vehicles to plan routes from origin to destination, considering optimal paths based on distance, speed limits, and traffic rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Localization and Navigation**  \n",
    "  With precise node and edge information, the vehicle can accurately localize itself within the network and navigate complex intersections, roundabouts, and lane changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Obstacle Avoidance and Maneuvering**  \n",
    "  In combination with real-time sensor data, the road network graph aids in making safe decisions, such as adjusting for obstacles and smoothly maneuvering around turns or merges.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Traffic Rule Compliance**  \n",
    "  By including regulatory information, the graph ensures that the vehicle follows traffic laws, such as stopping at intersections, yielding the right-of-way, and obeying speed limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Route Optimization and Traffic Adaptation**  \n",
    "  The graph enables dynamic route adjustments based on real-time traffic conditions, road closures, or construction zones.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Road Network Graph vs. Lanelet Maps\n",
    "\n",
    "While both **Road Network Graphs** and **Lanelet Maps** are essential for autonomous driving, they serve different roles:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Road Network Graphs**  \n",
    "  - Offer a broader structural overview, ideal for high-level navigation and route planning over larger areas, such as city-wide or interstate trips.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Lanelet Maps**  \n",
    "  - Focus on lane-level representation, which is crucial for precise, short-range navigation and lane-specific decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Integration in Self-Driving Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "Many self-driving systems combine both types of maps, using lanelet maps for detailed maneuvers and road network graphs for high-level route planning and navigation.\n"

    "# Depth-First Search (DFS) Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Depth-First Search (DFS)** algorithm is a graph traversal technique used to explore nodes and edges of a graph systematically. DFS begins at a starting node (often referred to as the \"root\" node in a tree structure) and explores as far down one path as possible before backtracking. It is commonly used in scenarios where all nodes or paths need to be explored, such as solving mazes, analyzing networks, or finding connected components.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How DFS Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Starting Point**:  \n",
    "   - Choose a starting node. This node becomes the root of the traversal.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Visit Nodes**:  \n",
    "   - Mark the current node as \"visited.\"\n",
    "   - Visit an adjacent, unvisited node and repeat the process from this new node.\n",
    "   - Continue moving to unvisited adjacent nodes, going deeper into the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Backtracking**:  \n",
    "   - When a node has no unvisited adjacent nodes, backtrack to the previous node and continue the search from there.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Repeat**:  \n",
    "   - Repeat the process until all nodes connected to the starting node have been visited.\n",
    "\n",
    "DFS can be implemented using **recursion** (stack-based) or explicitly using a **stack** data structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "## DFS Algorithm (Recursive)\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def dfs_recursive(graph, node, visited=None):\n",
    "    if visited is None:\n",
    "        visited = set()\n",
    "    visited.add(node)\n",
    "    print(node, end=\" \")\n",
    "\n",
    "    for neighbor in graph[node]:\n",
    "        if neighbor not in visited:\n",
    "            dfs_recursive(graph, neighbor, visited)\n"

    "# Breadth-First Search (BFS) Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** algorithm is a graph traversal method used to explore all nodes of a graph level by level, or breadth-wise. BFS starts from a selected node (often called the \"root\" in tree structures) and explores all of its neighbors before moving to the next level of nodes. BFS is commonly used in scenarios requiring the shortest path in unweighted graphs, analyzing social networks, or performing level-order traversal in trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How BFS Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Starting Point**:  \n",
    "   - Begin with a starting node and mark it as \"visited.\"\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Queue for Level Order Traversal**:  \n",
    "   - Add the starting node to a queue. This queue will keep track of nodes to be visited next.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Visit Nodes Level by Level**:\n",
    "   - Remove the front node from the queue and visit it.\n",
    "   - Add all unvisited neighbors of this node to the back of the queue and mark them as visited.\n",
    "   \n",
    "4. **Repeat Until Queue is Empty**:\n",
    "   - Continue the process until the queue is empty, indicating that all reachable nodes have been visited.\n",
    "\n",
    "## BFS Algorithm (Iterative)\n",
    "\n",
    "The BFS algorithm is typically implemented using a **queue** data structure for level-order traversal.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from collections import deque\n",
    "\n",
    "def bfs(graph, start):\n",
    "    visited = set()             # Set to keep track of visited nodes\n",
    "    queue = deque([start])      # Initialize the queue with the starting node\n",
    "    visited.add(start)\n",
    "\n",
    "    while queue:\n",
