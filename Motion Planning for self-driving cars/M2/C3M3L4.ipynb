    "# Hierarchical Planner\n",
    "\n",
    "- Motion planning broken into hierarchy of subproblems\n",
    "- Mission planner is highest level, focuses on map-level navigation\n",
    "- Behavioural planner focuses on other agents, rules of the road, driving behaviours\n",
    "- Local planner focus on generating feasible, colission free paths\n",

    "# Mission planner\n",
    "\n",
    "- Highest level planner\n",
    "- Focus on autonomous driving mission: Navigate to destination at the map level\n",
    "- Abstract way lower level details\n",
    "- Can be solved with graph-based methods\n",
    "\n",
    "# Behavioural Planner\n",
    "\n",
    "- Behavioural planner decides when it is safe to proceed\n",
    "- Takes predestrians, vehicles, cyclists into consideration\n",
    "- Also looks at regulatory elements, such as traffic lights and stop signs\n",
    "\n",
    "# Behavioural planner - Finite state machine\n",
    "\n",
    "- Composed of states and transitions\n",
    "1. States are based on perception of surroundings\n",
    "2. Transitions are based on inputs to the driving scenario: e.g. stop lights changing colour\n",
    "\n",
    "- FMS is memory less: Transitions only depend on input and current state, and not on past state sequence\n",
    "\n",
    "# Behavioural planner - Rule-based system\n",
    "\n",
    "- Rule-based systems use a hierarchy of rule to determine output behaviour\n",
    "- Rules are evaluated based on logical predicates: Higher priority rules have precedence\n",
    "1. Predicates -> Rule evaluation -> Rule resolution -> Maneuver decision\n",
    "\n",
    "# Local planner\n",
    "\n",
    "- Local planning generates feasible, collision-free paths and comfortable velocity profiles\n",
    "- Decomposed into path planning and velocity profile generation\n",
    "\n",
    "# Sampling-based planners\n",
    "\n",
    "- Randomly sample the control inputs to quickly explore the workspace\n",
    "- Collision-checking is performed as new points are added to the explored space\n",
    "- Often very fast, but can generate poor-quality paths\n",
    "\n",
    "# Variational planners\n",
    "\n",
    "- Optimize trajectory according to cost functional: Contains penalties for collision avoidance and robot dynamics\n",
    "- Can be slower, and less likely to converge to a feasible solution\n",
    "\n",
    "# Lattice planner\n",
    "\n",
    "- Constrain the search space by limiting actions available to the robot. Set of actions known as control set. \n",
    "- Layers of control actions form a graph\n",
    "- Conformal lattice planner fits the control actions to the road structure. "
