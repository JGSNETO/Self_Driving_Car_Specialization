    "- Features descriprtos should have the following characteristics:\n",
    "1. Repeatability: manifested as robustness an invariance to translation, rotation, scale and illuination changes. \n",
    "2. Distinctiveness: Should allow us to distinguish between two close by features, very important for matching later on.\n",
    "3. Compactness & Efficiency: Reasonable computation time\n",

    "- Feature descriptors are N-dimensional vectors characterizing an image's point of interest.\n",
    "- Features descriptors should be repeatable, distinctive, compact and efficient. "
