    "- Self-driving vehicles rely on data streams from many different sensors(Cameras, IMUs, LIDAR, RADAR, GPS)\n",

    "## Calibration\n",
    "\n",
    "- What do we need to know about our sensors and the vehicle to do sensor fusion ?\n",
    "1. Sensor models, which may depend on car-specific parameters\n",
    "2. Relative poses between each sensor pair, so we can combine information in a common reference frame\n",
    "3. Time offsets between sensor polling times, so we combine only synchronized information\n",
    "- There are all critical forms of calibration.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Accuracy Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "- How accurate does the estimator need to be for safe self-driving\n",
    "- Typically less than a meter for highway lane keeping\n",
    "- Less for driving in dense traffic\n",
    "- GPS accuracy is 1-5 meters in optimal conditions: Need aditional sensors\n",
    "\n",
    "## Speed requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "- How fast do we need to update the vehicle state to ensure safe driving ?\n",
    "- How much computational power does the vehicle have on-board ?\n",
    "- How much power can or computing resources consume ?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pratical state estimation typically fuses data from multiple sensors\n",
    "- Calibration is important for correct sensor fusion\n",
    "- Estimation algorithms must be designed with speed and accuracy requirements in mind\n",
    "- Need to be able to cope with localization failures and environmental changes"

    "## Why use GNSS with IMY & LIDAR ?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Error dynamics are completely different and uncorrelated\n",
    "- IMU provides 'smoothing' of GNSS, fill-in during outages due to jamming or maneuvering\n",
    "- Wheel odometry is also possible(if only 2D position orientation is designed)\n",
    "- GNSS provides absolute positioning information to mitigate IMU drift\n",
    "- LIDAR provides accurate local positioning within known maps\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- We used a loosely coupled EKF to fuse GNSS with IMU and LIDAR measurement\n",
    "- Assumptions:\n",
    "1. LIDAR provides positioning in the same reference frame as GNSS (possible)\n",
    "2. IMU has no biases (not realistic)\n",
    "3. State initialization is provided"
