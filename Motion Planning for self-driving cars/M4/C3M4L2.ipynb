    "\n",
    "Graphs are a fundamental data structure in computer science. They consist of **nodes** (also called **vertices**) and **edges** that connect pairs of nodes. Graphs are commonly used to represent networks, such as social networks, transportation networks, and communication networks. Graphs can be either **unweighted** or **weighted**, depending on the properties of the edges.\n",

    "\n",
    "An **unweighted graph** is a graph in which each edge does not have a weight or cost associated with it. The edges simply represent connections between nodes without any additional information about the distance, cost, or capacity of those connections.\n",

    "# Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Dijkstra's algorithm is a popular method used to find the shortest path from a **starting node** (or source) to all other nodes in a **weighted graph**. This algorithm works only with graphs that have non-negative weights. Named after Edsger Dijkstra, who developed it in 1956, the algorithm is commonly used in various fields such as network routing, navigation, and logistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How Dijkstra's Algorithm Works\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm uses a **greedy approach** to find the shortest path to each node. Starting from the source node, it repeatedly chooses the node with the smallest known distance, updates the distances to its neighboring nodes, and marks the node as \"visited\" once processed. This process continues until all nodes are visited or the shortest path to each node is determined.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps of the Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialize Distances**:\n",
    "   - Set the distance from the source node to itself as `0`.\n",
    "   - Set the distance to all other nodes as infinity (`∞`), since initially, they are unknown.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Initialize a Priority Queue**:\n",
    "   - Use a priority queue (often implemented with a min-heap) to keep track of nodes and their tentative distances.\n",
    "   - Initially, the source node is placed in the queue with a distance of `0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Process Each Node**:\n",
    "   - While there are nodes in the queue:\n",
    "     1. Remove the node with the smallest distance (let's call this the **current node**).\n",
    "     2. For each neighboring node, calculate the distance from the source node to this neighbor through the current node.\n",
    "     3. If this calculated distance is smaller than the current known distance to that neighbor, update the distance and add the neighbor to the priority queue.\n",
    "     4. Mark the current node as visited so it does not get processed again.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Terminate**:\n",
    "   - The algorithm finishes when all nodes have been visited or the shortest path to each node has been found.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a graph with nodes labeled `A`, `B`, `C`, `D`, and `E` and the following edge weights:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Goal**: Find the shortest path from `A` to all other nodes.\n",
    "- **Process**:\n",
    "  - Start from `A`: `dist(A) = 0`, all others = `∞`.\n",
    "  - Update distances to neighbors (`D` and `B`).\n",
    "  - Move to the next closest unvisited node, update distances, and repeat until all nodes are processed.\n",
