    "# Collision Checking Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "- Computationally intensive\n",
    "- Requires perfect information to guarantee safety\n",
    "- Needs to be approximated, and must be robust to noise\n",
    "\n",
    "# Swath Computation\n",
    "\n",
    "- Area occupied by car along path generated by rotating the car's footprint by each x, y, 0 along the path\n",
    "- Swath along path is the unioun of each rotated and translated footprint\n",
    "- Swath can then be checked for collisions\n",
    "\n",
    "# Lattice planner swaths\n",
    "\n",
    "- Swath based methods are useful for lattice planners, as the swath sets can be computed offline\n",
    "- Online collision checking is then simplified using lookup tables\n",
    "\n",
    "# Discretization resolution\n",
    "\n",
    "- Collision checking accuracy is impacted by the resolution of our discretization\n",
    "- Higher fidelity collision checking requires a finer resolution for occupancy grids and path points, and will require more computational resources"
