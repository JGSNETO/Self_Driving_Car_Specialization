    "# Lanete map\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the context of self-driving cars, a LANElet map is a apecialized type of map that represents the road network in terms of individuals lanes rather than just general roads. Lanelets break down roadways into smallet, more granular units, allowing autonomous vehicles to navigate precisely within individuals lanes, follow traffic rules and interact safely with other road users. \n",
