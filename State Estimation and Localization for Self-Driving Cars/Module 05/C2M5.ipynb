    "# Light Detection and Ranging Sensors\n",
    "\n",
    "- LIDAR originated in the 1960s shortly after the invention of the laser. \n",
    "- First used by meteorologists to measure clouds.\n",
    "- Nom commonly used for surveying and mapping.\n",
    "- 3D LIDAR sensors report range, aimuth angle and elevation angle (+ return intensity).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sources of measurement noise\n",
    "\n",
    "- Uncertainty in determining the exact time of arrival of the refleced signal.\n",
    "- Uncertainty in measuring the exact orientation of the mirror.\n",
    "- Interaction with the target(surface absorption, specular reflection).\n",
    "- Variation of propagation speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motion Distortion\n",
    "\n",
    "- Typical scan rate for a 3D LIDAR is 5-20 hz.\n",
    "- For a moving vehicle, each poit in a scan is taken from a slightly different place.\n",
    "- Need to account for this if the vehicle is moving quickly, otherwise motion distortion becomes a problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- LIDAR sensors use laser pulses and time-of-flight to measure distances to objects along a specific direction.\n",
    "- 2D and 3D LIDARs work by sweeping the laser pulses in many directions across the whole environment.\n",
