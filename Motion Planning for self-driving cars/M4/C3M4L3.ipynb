    "# A* Search Path Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "A* (A-star) is a popular pathfinding algorithm that finds the shortest path between two nodes (or points) in a weighted graph. It is widely used in computer science for applications that involve navigating maps, solving puzzles, and determining optimal paths in video games. A* improves upon Dijkstra's algorithm by using both path cost and an estimated cost to the goal, making it more efficient for certain types of searches.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How A* Works\n",
    "\n",
    "A* uses a **heuristic function** to estimate the cost of reaching the goal from any node, guiding the search to expand nodes that seem promising. It keeps track of two key costs for each node:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **g(n)**: The actual cost from the start node to node `n`.\n",
    "- **h(n)**: The heuristic (estimated) cost from node `n` to the goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sum of these costs gives the **f(n)** score:\n",
    "- **f(n) = g(n) + h(n)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Nodes with lower `f(n)` scores are prioritized, which balances moving towards the goal while minimizing the path cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps of the Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialize Open and Closed Sets**:\n",
    "   - **Open Set**: A priority queue of nodes to be evaluated, initially containing only the start node.\n",
    "   - **Closed Set**: A set of nodes that have already been evaluated.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Evaluate Nodes**:\n",
    "   - While the Open Set is not empty:\n",
    "     1. Remove the node `n` with the lowest `f(n)` from the Open Set.\n",
    "     2. If `n` is the goal node, terminate; the shortest path has been found.\n",
    "     3. Move `n` to the Closed Set.\n",
    "     4. For each neighbor `m` of `n`:\n",
    "         - If `m` is in the Closed Set, skip it.\n",
    "         - Calculate `g(m)` by adding the cost from `n` to `m`.\n",
    "         - If `m` is not in the Open Set or the new `g(m)` is lower than the previously recorded cost:\n",
    "             - Update `g(m)`, `h(m)`, and `f(m)`.\n",
    "             - Set `n` as the parent of `m` (to reconstruct the path later).\n",
    "             - Add `m` to the Open Set if it's not already there.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Path Reconstruction**:\n",
    "   - Once the goal is reached, backtrack from the goal node to the start node using the parent pointers to reconstruct the shortest path.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Choosing the Heuristic\n",
    "\n",
    "The heuristic function `h(n)` plays a crucial role in A*. Common heuristics include:\n",
    "- **Manhattan Distance**: Suitable for grids, calculated as the sum of horizontal and vertical distances.\n",
    "- **Euclidean Distance**: Useful for graphs where diagonal movement is allowed.\n",
    "- **Admissible Heuristics**: A heuristic is admissible if it never overestimates the true distance to the goal, ensuring A* finds the optimal path.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pseudocode\n",

    "function A*(start, goal):\n",

    "    g_score = {}                 // Cost from start to each node\n",
